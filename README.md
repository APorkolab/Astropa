## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Java 21 or later
-   Maven 3.6 or later
-   Node.js 16 or later
-   Angular CLI 20 or later

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Build the project:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```
3.  Run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the Angular development server:
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```
    The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:4200`. The application will automatically proxy requests to the backend.

## API Documentation

This project uses Swagger for automatic API documentation. Once the backend is running, you can access the Swagger UI at the following URL:

[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

The OpenAPI 3.0 specification is available in JSON format at:

[http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)

## Security

This application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. The backend is secured with Spring Security.

### Authentication Flow

1.  **Register:** New users can register via the `/api/auth/signup` endpoint.
2.  **Login:** Users can log in via the `/api/auth/signin` endpoint with their username and password. Upon successful authentication, the API returns a JWT.
3.  **Authenticated Requests:** The frontend application must include the received JWT in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent requests to protected API endpoints. The header should be in the format `Bearer {jwt_token}`.

### Public vs. Protected Endpoints

-   **Public Endpoints:**
    -   `/api/auth/**`: User registration and login.
    -   `/swagger-ui.html` and `/api-docs/**`: API documentation.
-   **Protected Endpoints:** All other API endpoints require authentication.

## API Endpoints

-   `GET /api/zodiacs/findByDate?date={YYYY-MM-DD}`: Get zodiac sign by date.
-   `GET /api/compatibilities/{zodiac1Name}/{zodiac2Name}`: Get compatibility between two zodiac signs.

## Deployment

The CI pipeline consists of two jobs:
-   `build-backend`: Builds the Spring Boot application.
-   `build-frontend`: Builds the Angular application.
