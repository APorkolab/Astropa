- **Security scanning** (dependencies, containers, SAST)
- **Code quality gates** with SonarQube
- **Automated testing** at multiple levels
- **Optional token handling** to prevent pipeline failures
- **GitOps integration** for deployment automation

### 📚 Documentation & Operations
- **Comprehensive deployment guide** with step-by-step instructions
- **Operations runbooks** for troubleshooting
- **Production checklists** for go-live readiness
- **Emergency procedures** for incident response
- **Architecture diagrams** and decision records
